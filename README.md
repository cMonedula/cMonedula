- 👋 Hi, I’m @cMonedula - you can also call me Dante, Anzu or Zuz (any pronouns). I am a second year Biomedical Engineering student, currently preparing for my bachelor's thesis.
- 👀 I’m interested in f...ing around and finding out (at least when it's related to my topics of interest). I also like translating things (I am a native speaker of Slovak and fluent in English) - I have contributed quite a few lines to the Slovak translation of 0 A.D..
- 💻 I know a little Python, some C and some MATLAB. Yippee.
- ⌨️ Current passion project? Writing new firmware for a retro keyboard (which I've rebuilt to use an USB-C Pro Micro) as Soarer's Converter simply can't handle the number of function keys the keyboard has.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MATLAB, as it is required of me by school. I've been looking to try Kotlin, but there's only so many hours in a day. Oh, and I'd love to learn COBOL one day, just for the fun of it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing as of now, as I don't think my skills are of much value. Yet. 
- 📫 How to reach me? idk lol figure that out yourself.
