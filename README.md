- 👋 Hi, I’m @cMonedula - you can also call me Dante, Anzu or Zuz (any pronouns). I am a first year Biomedical Engineering student.
- 👀 I’m interested in f...ing around and finding out (at least when it's related to my topics of interest). Seriously, I learn the most by trial and error. I also like translating things (I am a native speaker of Slovak and fluent in English) - I have contributed quite a few lines to the Slovak translation of 0 A.D..
- ⌨️ I know a little Python. Yippee.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, as it is required of me by school. I've been looking to try Kotlin and MATLAB too, but there's only so many hours in a day. Oh, and I'd love to learn COBOL one day, just for the fun of it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing as of now, as I don't think my skills are of much value. Yet. Future passion project? Upgrading a Siemens Dimension RXL keyboard to USB-C and wireless. I just need to get my hands on one of those keebs first.
- 📫 How to reach me? idk lol figure that out yourself. Recruiters for non-biomed companies, leave me the hell alone. Thanks. Siemens Healthineers recruiters, however, are more than welcome to slide into my inbox.
