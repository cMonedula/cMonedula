- 👋 Hi, I’m @cMonedula - you can also call me Dante or Zuz (any pronouns).
- 👀 I’m interested in f...ing around and finding out (at least when it's related to my topics of interest). Seriously, I learn the most by trial and error.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, as it is required of me by school. I've been looking to try Kotlin and C too, but there's only so many hours in a day.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing as of now, as I don't think my skills are of much value. Yet. My aim as of right now is making a custom Darkest Dungeon character mod.
- 📫 How to reach me? idk lol figure that out yourself
